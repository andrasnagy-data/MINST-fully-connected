**Fully connected Neural Net trained on the MINST dataset.**

The model has 2 hidden layers, each layer consists of 16 neurons.
The model starts over-fitting after the 5th epoch.

During this project, I learned about data sets (dataset class for deep learning), data loaders (iterator wrapped around the dataset class), model architecture and training loop (with evaluation).

The model's accuracy after the 5th epoch was ~94 %.
